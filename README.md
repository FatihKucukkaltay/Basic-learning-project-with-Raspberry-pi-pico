# ðŸš¦ Traffic Light System with Buzzer â€“ Raspberry Pi Pico Project

This is a basic beginner-level Raspberry Pi Pico project using MicroPython.  
It simulates a traffic light system using red, yellow, and green LEDs, and plays a buzzer sound every time a light changes â€“ just like in a racing start!

## ðŸŽ¯ What Youâ€™ll Learn

- How to control LEDs with GPIO pins
- How to use a passive buzzer with PWM
- Basic timing and delays using `sleep()`
- Combining lights and sound to simulate real systems

## ðŸ§° Components Used

- Raspberry Pi Pico
- Red LED (x1)
- Yellow LED (x1)
- Green LED (x1)
- 220Î© resistors (x3)
- Passive buzzer (x1)
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard
